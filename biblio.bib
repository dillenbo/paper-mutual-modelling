  notes = {- The "Ann and Sally" experiment.
	
	A child watches this scene: Ann watches Sally to put an object in
	a basket. Sally leaves and Ann moves the object from the basket to
	the table.
	
	The child is asked: where Sally will look for the object when she
	will return?
	
	
	The paper explain that children under 4 (as well as autistic children)
	doesn't answer "on the table"
	
	The robot can successfully pass this test if and only if it has an
	explicit and independent model for Sally believes on the world. So
	it should work with ORO. But it's a great experiment to set up!
	
	
	- The ToMM-SP model: Leslie proposes a general Theory of Mind Mechanism
	model based on what he call M-representation. M-representation are
	made of four components. An (1) agent, an (2) attitude (Leslie names
	3 of them: to pretend, to believe or to want), an (3) "aspect of
	the world that anchors the agent's attitude" and the (4) content
	of the attitude.
	
	The example he takes is a mother that plays and uses a banana as a
	phone. If correctly understood by the children, this scene can be
	interpreted as: the (1) mother (2) pretend-true (3) the banana (4)
	to be a telephone.
	
	
	I would be curious to know your opinion about how feasible it would
	be to get the robot to actually understand the "mother and banana"
	scene.
	
	
	In false-belief scenarii (like the Sally-Ann one), the child must
	be able to attribute a false belief to the agent.
	
	Leslie adds to the model ToMM model a Selection Processing (SP) that
	allows the belief attributer to /inhibit/ the default (true) belief
	that he/she would tend to attribute to the agent.
	
	
	The whole model looks extremely relevant for us and I think it could
	be integrated in our current modelling of knowledge.},
